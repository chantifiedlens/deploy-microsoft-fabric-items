## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this extension you may file a private issue with the label `security` on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ChantifiedLens/Deploy-Microsoft-Fabric-Items.

Do not open a public issue with PoC code or sensitive details—this could expose users.

We will respond when possible and provide updates on mitigation steps and timelines.


## Security Best Practices (for users of this composite GitHub Action)

- Use least-privilege for the service principal (grant only the minimal permissions required).
- For extra safety, run your build in a minimal, ephemeral runner.


## Triage & Disclosure

- We follow a coordinated disclosure model. After acknowledgement, we will provide remediation timeline and patches privately.
- For severe vulnerabilities we will coordinate with the GitHub Marketplace team if required.
